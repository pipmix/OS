Semaphore operations P() and V() are assumed to be atomic. Assuming that a test_and_set()
operation is available, show how atomic semaphore operations could be implemented. You must define
the semaphore data type with all its corresponding operations.

struct Semaphore {

	int lock;

	Semaphore(int x){

		lock = 0;

	}

	void P(){

		while (test_and_set(&lock)){
			// Loop Until Available
		}

				// Do operation

		lock = 0;


	
	}

	void V() {

		while (test_and_set(&lock)){
			// Loop Until Available
		}

		// Do operation
		
		lock = 0;
	}
};
